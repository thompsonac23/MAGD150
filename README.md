# MAGD150

Below are descriptions of several labs I have created from September 13th, 2017 to November 5th, 2017.

[Lab01](https://github.com/thompsonac23/MAGD150/blob/master/Lab01.pde)
-Using a multitude of points and polygons, I created a starry, city landscape in black and white. 

[Lab02](https://github.com/thompsonac23/MAGD150/blob/master/Lab02.pde)
-Using frequent ellipses and bezier curves, I created a galactic themed scape with a few textured planets and stars in the background.

[Lab03](https://github.com/thompsonac23/MAGD150/blob/master/Lab03.pde)
-In this assignment I created a desktop theme-esque interaction with mostly ellipses. Every few seconds some of the ellipses will blink different colors, and circles will spawn as the mouse moves across the screen.

[Lab04](https://github.com/thompsonac23/MAGD150/blob/master/Lab04.pde)
-This project is entirely about everyone's favorite, pizza. All variables are ellipses again. A simple pizza will follow the mouse's location, and when the mouse is clicked another will pop up in the right corner of the background. Along with a mouseclick, if a key is pressed on the keyboard, yet another, different, pizza will appear in the lower left.

[Lab08](https://github.com/thompsonac23/MAGD150/blob/master/Lab08.pde)
-In this last project, I created a movie poster inspired piece, space themed, of course. Using a purple color scheme, I made a spacial landscape with a few planets and textured ground. Utilizing and loading specific fonts, I animated part of the text to scroll across the screen at the top, while the other text rests static at the bottom.
